== Overview

This project contains a bit of integration code that assists with managing OpenSCAP
scans across a fleet of instances. The example integration contains an RPM built for CentOS 7 that will install OpenSCAP
and all dependencies along with a https://www.open-scap.org/resources/documentation/customizing-scap-security-guide-for-your-use-case/[tailoring file]
that allows you to adjust security policies the needs of your organization.

== Building

The project includes a Makefile that automates the creation of the RPM using a Docker container. Docker
must be installed already on your machine.

    make rpm

== Deployment

The RPM requires that the AWS CLI be installed but does not require that you do it using the official RPMs. If you
don't have a preference then ensuring you have the EPEL repo configured and installing using commands like the following
is the easiest method to install onto your servers.

    yum -y install epel-release
    yum -y install awscli openscap-aws

=== Example

There is a CloudFormation template in the examples directory that can be used to demonstrate the capability. It will
create 3 EC2 micro sized instances which cost about a cent per hour.

=== Setup

Before deploying the CloudFormation template complete the following steps

* Ensure you have both `make` and `docker` installed on your workstation
* Create an S3 bucket to hold you custom tailoring file and the RPM
  ** Accept all the defaults and keep the bucket permissions set to private
* Run `make rpm` and upload the rpm file found in the src/rpm/RPMS/noarch directory
  ** If you regularly manage your systems via RPM you might have a custom RPM repo already created into which you'd
     add this RPM instead of uploading to your configuration S3 bucket
* Review, update and upload the tailoring file located in the /src/rpm/SOURCES directory into the S3 bucket
