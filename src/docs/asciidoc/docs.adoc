== Overview

This project contains integration code that assists with managing https://www.open-scap.org[OpenSCAP^] scans across a
fleet of instances. The example deployment template automates the creation of a demonstration environment meant to show
a working example of the automation process.


The kay takeaways from this demonstration are as follows:

* Automating compliance auditing is the only way to meet established goals at scale
* Customized organizational policies are supported through the user of a https://www.open-scap.org/resources/documentation/customizing-scap-security-guide-for-your-use-case/[tailoring file]
* The publishing of metrics and failure events supports customized organizational processes and responses

The folks at OpenSCAP/RedHat have a number of https://www.open-scap.org/tools/[additional tools] to manage servers at
scale which can schedule and ingest scan result content. This project is meant to demonstrate lightweight alternative
approaches with an emphasis on integration with AWS services.

== Building

The project includes a Makefile that automates the creation of the RPM using a Docker container. Docker
must be installed already on your machine.

    make rpm

== Deployment

The RPM requires that the AWS CLI be installed but does not require that you do it using the official RPMs. If you
don't have a preference then ensuring you have the EPEL repo configured and installing using commands like the following
is the easiest method to install onto your servers.

    yum -y install epel-release
    yum -y install awscli openscap-aws

=== Example

There is a CloudFormation template in the examples directory that can be used to demonstrate the capability. The default
settings will create 3 EC2 micro sized instances which each cost about a cent per hour.

=== Setup

Before deploying the CloudFormation template complete the following steps

* Ensure you have both `make` and `docker` installed on your workstation
* Create an S3 bucket to hold your custom tailoring file and the RPM
  ** Accept all the defaults and keep the bucket permissions set to private
* Run `make rpm` and upload the rpm file found in the src/rpm/RPMS/noarch directory to your S3 bucket
  ** If you regularly manage your systems via RPM you might have a custom RPM repo already created into which you'd
     add this RPM instead of uploading to your configuration S3 bucket
* Review, update and upload the tailoring file located in the /src/rpm/SOURCES directory into the S3 bucket
